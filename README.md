# Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

This repository contains the final project completed in the context of the **Reinforcement Learning course at École polytechnique** supervised by Luiz Chamon

The project is based on the paper:

**Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor**  
Tuomas Haarnoja, Aurick Zhou, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine (2018)

It includes a theoretical study of maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, an implementation of **soft policy iteration** in a discrete setting, and empirical experiments with **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)** in continuous control environments.

The work was concluded by an **oral presentation delivered in front of a jury** as part of the course evaluation.
