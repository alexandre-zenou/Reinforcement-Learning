# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains a theoretical review and a practical implementation of the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm (Haarnoja et al., 2018). It includes a derivation of soft policy iteration, a tabular implementation on Taxi-v3, and experimental comparisons between SAC, PPO, and DDPG using Stable-Baselines3.
